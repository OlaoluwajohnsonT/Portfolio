        </a>
        <p>In analyzing automobile data, I performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover latent patterns and streamline dimensionality. With 201 entries and 29 columns, I explored numerical attributes like wheel-base and categorical data such as make and body style. Addressing missing values, I identified key features contributing to dataset variance. PCA revealed crucial insights, enhancing model efficiency and decision-making processes for predictive modelling in the automotive domain.</p>
