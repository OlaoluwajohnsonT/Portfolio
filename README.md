## Data Analytics Projects üìà

- [Bike Trip Data Google Analytics Case Study](https://github.com/OlaoluwajohnsonT/Bike-Trip-Datat-Google-Analytics-Case-Study)

In this project, I analyze the usage patterns of Cyclistic's bike-share program to understand the differences between annual members and casual riders. The objective is to provide insights that will inform the development of a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
  
- [The Bellabeat Company Case Study](https://github.com/OlaoluwajohnsonT/The-BellaBeat-Company-Case-Study)

In this case study, I find myself on the marketing analytics team at Bellabeat, a company specializing in health-focused products for women. Our mission is to unlock growth opportunities for the company by analyzing smart device fitness data. Under the guidance of Bellabeat's co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Ur≈°ka Sr≈°en, I'm tasked with delving into smart device usage trends.


## Machine Learning Projects ü§ñ

- [PCA ANALYSIS FOR AUTOMOTIVE DATA](https://github.com/OlaoluwajohnsonT/PCA-ANALYSIS-FOR-AUTOMOTIVE-DATA-Project)

I conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the dataset to uncover latent patterns and reduce its dimensionality. PCA is a powerful technique that transforms correlated features into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. This allows for a more concise representation of the data while preserving as much of the original information as possible. In this analysis, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset's structure and identify key features contributing to its variance.

- [Natural Language Processing For Trump Tweet Sentimental Analysis Project](https://github.com/OlaoluwajohnsonT/Twitter-Trump-tweet-Sentimental-Analysis-Project)

I conducted a sentiment analysis using a dataset that contains a collection of text data sourced from Twitter. In this analysis, my primary objective was to gain insights into the sentiments expressed within this dataset, uncovering the emotions and opinions shared by Twitter users.

- [Apple Stock Price Prediction and EDA Analysis](https://github.com/OlaoluwajohnsonT/Apple-Stock-Price-from-1980-2021)

I have the privilege of working with a dataset that spans over four decades of Apple Inc.'s stock market performance, collected meticulously from Yahoo Finance. This dataset presents a golden opportunity for Time Series Analysis (TSA) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
