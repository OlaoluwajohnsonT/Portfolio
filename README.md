In this report, I analyzed Cyclistic's historical trip data to understand usage patterns and develop a marketing strategy. By examining trip duration, day of the week, and customer behavior, I aimed to convert casual riders into annual members. Data was collected from Cyclistic's database, organized, and verified for credibility. Using Python and Power BI, I performed descriptive analysis and prepared insights for strategic decision-making.

Examining FitBit data, I analyze usage trends to bolster BellaBeat's marketing strategy. Utilizing Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I delve into minute-level physical activity, heart rate, and sleep patterns. Insights derived inform BellaBeat's approach, aiding in targeted marketing efforts and product enhancements. This independent project aims to leverage smart device data for actionable recommendations, aligning with BellaBeat's health-focused mission.

In this hospital project, I investigated visitor patterns, revenue sources, and patient correlations. Notably, insurance types lead revenue, with 40% attributed to insurance, followed by Corporate and HMO. Peak revenue occurs between 8 and 10 am. Correlating patient IDs with revenue unveils insightful relationships. Leveraging Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I provide actionable insights for optimizing hospital operations and revenue generation, facilitating strategic decision-making.

Analyzing the 2022 Forbes dataset, I delve into attributes like name, net worth, and industry to uncover trends among global billionaires. By utilizing Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I clean, analyze, and visualize the data, aiming to extract valuable insights into wealth distribution, industry dominance, and demographic characteristics. This analysis offers a unique glimpse into the world's wealthiest individuals, shedding light on factors influencing their success and the broader economic landscape.

In this project, I analyzed COVID-19 vaccination data from the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), seeking insights to enhance public health strategies. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I cleaned, visualized, and analyzed the data. Through comprehensive analysis, I uncovered trends, patterns, and correlations in vaccination efforts. My findings informed policymakers and healthcare professionals, guiding evidence-based decision-making and optimizing vaccination strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic effectively.
